# Online Store Backend

## Description
This project is a backend implementation for an online store, developed as the final project for the Backend 1 course. It provides complete CRUD operations for managing products and shopping carts through a RESTful API. The system is continuously being improved as I learn more about Node.js, Express, storage solutions, sessions, and cookies.

### Technologies Used
* Node.js
