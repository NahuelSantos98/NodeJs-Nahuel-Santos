# Online Store Backend

## Description
This project is a backend implementation for an online store, developed as the final project for the Backend 1 course. It provides complete CRUD operations for managing products and shopping carts through a RESTful API. The system is continuously being improved as I learn more about Node.js, Express, storage solutions, sessions, and cookies.

### Technologies Used
* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Postman (for API testing)

## Functionality
The system implements a complete RESTful API that allows for product and shopping cart management. All endpoints have been thoroughly tested using Postman to ensure proper functionality. The API supports full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for both products and shopping carts, providing a robust foundation for e-commerce applications.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_cluster_connection_string
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
